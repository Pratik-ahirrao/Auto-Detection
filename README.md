# Auto-Detection
Part of the mini- project for Visual Recognition Course<br>
I have used YOLOv5 model to train and test the image dataset<br>
LabelImg annotation tool is used to annotate the images and roboflow to store and organize the dataset.<br>
mAP (Mean Absolute Precision) score is calculated while training the model.
